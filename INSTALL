Dependencies
===============

The following dependences are assumed to be installed at compile time
and runtime for the Enterprise Security API (ESAPI):

* log4c 
* uthash
* libgcrypt

Note: If you need a FIPS 140-2 validated crypto module, you must use
the libcrypt version 1.4.4 included in Red Hat 5.4.

Installation
===============

Installation of the ESAPI library is fairly straightforward:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `make' to build the source. All the dependencies are assumed to be
     installed.

  2. Optionally type `make runtests' to run all the unit tests that ship
     with the source.

  3. Type `make install' to install the library.

  4. To clean up any object files and artifacts left hanging around from
     the build process, type `make clean'.
